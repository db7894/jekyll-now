I'm an intended CS/Math major at Harvey Mudd College. 

### Research

From January to December 2018 I was involved in the Music Information Retrieval Lab at Harvey Mudd College. As a member of this lab, I primarily worked on a project involving utilizing computer vision and object detection techniques to develop a system that could take an image of a page of sheet music and identify the name of the piece by searching for it in a massive database.

During this project, I learned a great deal about deep learning through completing fast.ai where I learned about the Keras, Theano and Tensorflow libraries as well as the mathematics behind deep learning involving Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. I learned how to use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup to implement a web scraper to download more than 400,000 PDFs from a website, implemented and iterated a number of machine learning architectures to solve various problems in Python, and performed a great deal of data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as Pandas in order to better understand our problem.
