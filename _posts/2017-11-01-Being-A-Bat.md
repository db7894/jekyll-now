## Hofstadter, Nagel, and the Limits of Consciousness

> The closing of the strange loop of human selfhood is deeply dependent upon the level-changing leap that is __perception__, which means __categorization__, and therefore, the richer and more powerful an organism's categorization equipment is, the more realized and rich will be its self. Conversely, the poorer an organism's repertoire of categories, the more impoverished will be the self, until in the limit there simply is no self at all. (Hofstadter 209)

In "I Am A Strange Loop", Douglas Hofstadter discusses human consciousness, what it means when we say "I", and what gives humans such a distinctive claim on this aspect of having an "I". An inward look, self-referential thought, and an infinite potential to self-examine through feedback loops gives us a trait that simply cannot be found in a non-human animal such as a mosquito. 

However, Hofstadter makes an important point. Humans are not __born__ with this I-ness as an innate quality. In fact, as babies, we do not yet have an "I". Rather, as we interact with the world over the course of our lives, we make the leaps of perception and categorization--these abilities to understand, evaluate and distinguish help us establish a realized "I". While these are not yet present in a baby, the __potential__ for them to develop is there, while for our mosquito friends, it simply isn't. 

In an article called "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Thomas Nagel articulates the point that it's impossible for a human to even __imagine__ what it would be like to live as a bat (or any other non-human creature, for that matter). Why is this? Well, for one, try to imagine having wings. It might not be so hard to dream of yourself flying over London, but are you really imagining it? Can you feel the physical sensation? What is your right wing feeling right now? What does it feel like attached to your body in comparison to, say, an arm? 

Maybe that example doesn't fully get it across, but imagine what it's like to be in the mind of a bat. What is it like to sense things through sound? What is it like to think as a bat? To hear? You probably can't imagine that. And that's because as humans, we have a fundamentally different level, a different form of consciousness from a bat. As we grew up, we formed that "I" that Hofstadter expounds--right now, you probably couldn't imagine yourself divorced from that identity that makes up the very core of who you are. 

But weren't we all babies once? Didn't we all go through that "phase" Hofstadter discusses, where we had a potential but didn't quite have an "I"? Weren't we just on the same level of mosquitos? Say you were a baby--could you then imagine what it's like being a mosquito? 

Probably not. As a baby, would you even have considered the question of what it's like to be another life-form? It's highly unlikely that you'd developed the consciousness, the level of self-understanding, the "loopiness" that would lead you to even consider such a brash idea.
