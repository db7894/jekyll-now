I'm a third-year Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. My coursework at Harvey Mudd has included a wide survey of STEM subjects including Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and so on from Harvey Mudd's Core. Recent courses I've taken have focused on topics and areas such as machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. In addition, my passion for other areas has led me to take courses in Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy. 

### More Information

I'm a Pakistani-American (US-born)--fun fact: I've probably spent as many New Year's in Lahore as in the States.

My interests include both theory and application of techniques in machine learning and data science. I care a lot about considering the effect of the systems and tools I build on the real world and finding ways to minimize cognitive bias in decision-making processes. I enjoy writing from time to time on topics such as South Asian American identity. 

In my free time, I love reading books and articles about topics from philosophy to politics. I enjoy playing the violin and staying active, and I'm a Bollywood addict.
