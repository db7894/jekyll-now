While you'll see that most of my experience is in research, I really care about making a concrete impact on the world around me and helping people live better lives. To that end, it's my goal to work in industry where I can do work that both speaks to me (on the level of my love for math, algorithms, and so on), but also has real-world uses and benefits for other people.

## Sheet Music Identification

Starting January 2019, I will be involved in the AMISTAD (Artificial Machine Intelligence = Search Targets Awaiting Discovery) lab with professor [George Monta√±ez](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gmontane/), professor of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College. The inspiration of the lab focuses on a framework for understanding Machine Learning that leverages aspects of statistical estimation, information theory, and algorithmic search. 
My research here will focus on theoretical Machine Learning, and projects will be similar to one I pursued as part of my coursework in Fall 2018 that involved proving upper bounds on the proportion of successful search problems in a continuous compact space. 

From January to December 2018 I was involved in the Music Information Retrieval Lab at Harvey Mudd College. As a member of this lab, I primarily worked on a project involving utilizing computer vision and object detection techniques to develop a system that could take an image of a page of sheet music and identify the name of the piece by searching for it in a massive database.

During this project, I learned a great deal about deep learning through completing fast.ai where I learned about the Keras, Theano and Tensorflow libraries as well as the mathematics behind deep learning involving Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. I learned how to use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup to implement a web scraper to download more than 400,000 PDFs from a website, implemented and iterated a number of machine learning architectures to solve various problems in Python, and performed a great deal of data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as Pandas in order to better understand our problem.

## Assorted Notebooks

Here you'll find a wide assortment of notebooks containing my work in various courses and attempts to explore interesting topics. Of note are my work where I finished Andrew Ng's **Machine Learning** Coursera, as well as Caltech's **Learning from Data**. 
In these two courses, I implemented the main suite of machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python using **Numpy**, **Scipy**, as well as utilizing **Scikit-Learn** for black-box algorithms and **Pandas** for data manipulation (in addition to Numpy).

You'll also find my work on assignments from CS 158 (Machine Learning) at HMC and a few examples of my attempts to implement basic Reinforcement Learning algorithms using Numpy.
